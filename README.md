## The Challenge

Here at Leeds Libraries we have special collections that represent things we are really interested in. How could you create a modern day version of some of the items in our collections? Maybe you could create an "interactive random generator for play bills" or maybe a "digital fortune teller" or something cycling related? We know you'll have some great ideas and we're really looking to see you build them!
